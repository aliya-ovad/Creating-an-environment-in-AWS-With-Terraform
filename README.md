A simple project in terraform that creates a safe work environment.
	
## Environment

I created a vpc

which has 4 subnet    2 of them are private     2 of them are public

and I put them in 2 availability zone

Each availability zone contains 2 subnet 1 privet 1 public

And for all subnets that are public we created a routing table with internet gateway that they will have access to the world

And for the subnets that are privet we created a routing table with net gateway associated with him Elastic IP address 

And with this we go to the routing table of public subnet And from there out into the world
